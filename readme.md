## Dataset

> The Dataset used in this analysis was that of Prosper Loan Data. The Propser loan dataset is a dataset of loans borrowed by people across the US. 
It contains many features (81) which include, interest rates, loan status, the borrower geographic state, etc. it consists of 113937 records. 
We try to explore this dataset with visualization using matplotlib and seaborn packages.

## Summary of Findings

> * Columns 'ClosedDate' and 'CreditGrade' contain lot of null values, hence I will drop these columns from my dataset. The remaining columns will be individually examined for null values and appropriately dealt with.Thus the dataframe will contain 27 columns and 113937 rows.

> * There are only 3 different loan terms in our dataset. 12 Months, 36 Months and 60 Months. As we can see from the above chart, it is clear that most people (77%) go for the 36 month term and about 22% go for the 60 month term and about 1% go for the 12 month term.

> * California has the highest number of borrowers accounting for approximately 14% of all borrowers in the U.S followed by Texas, new York and Florida with approximately 6% each. We would further like to analyze if any state has relatively higher number of defaulters than others. We would also like to discover state's share of the monetary amount borrowed.

> * Approximately 53% of borrowers are borrowing for Loan consolidation. This seems to be the primary purpose for Prosper Loans. Purpose of the loan is not available for 15% of the people. The other popular categories are Business and Home Improvement.

> * Among different professions almost 1/4th of the people belong to the "Other" category. Among the known Categories, Professionals constitute 12% followed by Computer Progammers. We can further analyze the Incomes, Borrower rates and other metrics by profession.

> * The Monthly Income distribtion is right skewed with the highest frequency in the  2200âˆ’  5000 range. We can further inspect relationship between income and Borrower rate.

> * The Debt to Income Ratio distribution is also right skewed. Most people lie below 0.5. 50% of the people lie between 0.14 and 0.32. This is a reasonable figure, as it indicates a relatively low debt compared to income. We can see there are quite a few people above 1. This distribution can be used as an indicator for the health of an economy.

> * Most loans are current (around 50%). There aren't many defaulters. They are about 5% of the popoulation. Further analysis needs to be done for this Defaulter population.

> * Distribution of credit scores shows that a score of 650-750 includes most of the population. Further relationship can be explored between credit score and borrower's interest rate.

> * There arent many delinquencies. They are only about 10000 which is approximately 10% of the population. The amount delinquent, however has a lot of outliers. This tells us that there are few delinquencies, but those that are delinquent vary greatly in terms of the amount. It can vary from few hundreds to $60000.

> * State with the highest total borrowing is California while state with the highest mean borrowing is DC. This gives us the insight that borrowers from DC tend to borrow higher amount of money whereas the borrowers from California are large in number and take out smaller loans. This kind of analysis can be applied to all states to analyze borrower behavior.

> * Most people lie in the credit score range of 600-700 and have an interest rate of 15%. However we see that Borrower rate is not affected by credit score alone, as there are many others in the heatmap with interest rates ranging from 20%-30% and still in the same credit score range of 600-700. We have to further analyze the relationship between interest rate and other features.

> * We see a general trend of increase in borrowers from 2006-2008, 2009-2013. Then there are dips in 2009 from 2008 and 2014 from 2013. The 2009 dip may be attributed to the financial crisis of 2008. However we need other data to verify this. The year 2013 has been the year with most borrowers.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The main insights i got from the multivariate analysis are that 
>the median borrower rates among defaults are higher than non defaults 
>and that the prosper score is good at predicting defaults among some employment categories 
>such as part time employees and bad for some categories like self employed borrowers.
